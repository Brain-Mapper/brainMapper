		When you launch the software for the first time, a set named "default" is already created.

		<img src="imgs/create_set.jpg" style="width:40%">

	<h3 id="rename_set">2.2. Rename a set</h3>
	<p>
		Each set works the same way. You will see a little menu next to the name of your set. Click on the little pen logo to access to the rename pop up. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You will not be able to name two sets the same way. Furthermore, the software prevent you to add unauthorized symbols to the name of your set, such as : "/",";"...
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="imgs/rename_set.jpg" style="width:20%">		
	</p>
	<h3 id="sub_set">2.3. Add a sub set</h3>
	<p>
		Each set can have an infinity of sub sets. It works exactly like a folder hierarchy. Each set, including the one that contains others, can contain some collections of images and data. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Each set  (even if its a sub set)works the same way. You will see a little menu next to the name of your set. Click on the arrow logo to access to the sub set pop up.

	<h2 id="collection">3. Collection</h2>
	<p>
		When you launch the software for the first time, a set named "default" is already created. That means, when you create a collection, it will be added to the current set, "default" in this case.
	</p>
	<p>
		A collection is an object where we stock the data. Usually, the data are some images, that's why we will name the Collection object as an Image Collection.
	</p>
	<h3 id="new_collection">3.1. Create a new collection</h3>
	<p>
		There are two ways to create a collection : with an Excel file containing the points and some NIfTI files. These two options are available in the menu : "New Collection".

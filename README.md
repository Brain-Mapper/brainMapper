An open source application that aims to automatize treatments to create a brain function atlas - Industrial Project 

## About this project
This is an Industrial Project in collaboration with the Central Hospital of Nancy (France).
Its aim was to create a tool to automatize the image treatment and clustering application on patients' medical data (NIfTI images, brain region-function associations, etc). This would then allow to create a brain function atlas that can be exported and shared in the neurosciences community.

This tool has thus two components :
 - A Python library that ensures all treatments of NIfTI Images and that is the core of this software. It can be used and incorporated into other applications of your making
 - A PyQt interface according to the needs of CHRU neurosurgeons

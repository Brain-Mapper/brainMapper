# NAME
#        usable_data
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#       'usable_data.py' contains the class declaration of object Usable Data,
#       which is a way of storing extracted data from NifTI files or imported data
#       from Excel/csv files
#       It might seem like a little bit too much overkill, but for us, it was simpler
#       to have an object store our usable data
#       It simplified all calculations on a given patient for example.
